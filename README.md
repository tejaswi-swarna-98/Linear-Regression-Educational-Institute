# Linear-Regression-Educational-Institute
The project is about a popular educational academy which specializes in preparing students for exams such as the GMAT, GRE, and SAT using unique problem-solving methods that ensure maximum scores with minimum effort.This project will involve a detailed analysis of the factors that influence graduate admissions. We will use statistical methods to understand the relationships between these factors and develop a predictive model that can estimate a student’s chances of admission based on these variables.

## **Overview**
The goal of this project is to help the academy understand the various factors that play a crucial role in graduate admissions and how these factors interrelate. This analysis will also assist in predicting a student’s chances of admission based on the given variables.

## **Project Flow** 
  1. Data Pre-Processing
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Model Building
  4. Conclusions and Recommendations

## **Project Problem Statement**
The academy has recently launched a feature on their website that allows students to estimate their probability of getting into Ivy League colleges. This feature is designed from an Indian perspective, providing a tailored approach for students seeking admission to graduate programs abroad. Academy wants to know which factors are crucial in graduate admissions.
